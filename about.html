      <p>This tool is still in development and should not be considered a finished product. </p>
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>Plotter is a tool that creates scatterplots of NFL player data. It was developed specifically with fantasy football in mind, to help visualize trends that occur over time at a positional level. For instance, graphing fantasy points against position rank for 2012 and 2008 shows that in general the <em>n</em>-th highest scoring running back contributed substantially more points over a season in 2008 than in 2012. These kinds of insights can–and should–inform draft strategy and roster construction.</p>
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>I based the visual style on a set of <a href="http://cssdeck.com/labs/flat-forms">flat form elements</a> I had previously developed. Colors are cribbed from <a href="http://flatuicolors.com">Flat UI Colors</a>. The typeface used here is <a href="http://www.daltonmaag.com/buyonline/fonts/effra">Effra</a>, served by <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts">Typekit</a>.</p>
      <h2>Code</h2>
      <p>Plotter runs on <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and is currently hosted on <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift</a>. It was developed in the browser with <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a>. The Node server is extremely light and doesn't connect to a database. The dataset is a single large JSON file, delivered to the client asynchronously, and all code runs on the client as well. The script has been rewritten a few times; currently it uses the revealing module pattern and is compiled from <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>.</p>
      <p>The chart drawing function uses <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>, a great data visualization library. Other libraries include: <a href="http://brehaut.net/code/color">Color.js</a> for color manipulation; <a href="http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/">Chosen.js</a> with a <a href="https://github.com/nickb1080/chosen/blob/master/public/chosen.css">custom stylesheet</a> using relative units and a tiny data-URI font for icons; and of course <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.</p>
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>This dataset is collected from the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2012/fantasy.htm">fantasy stats</a> provided by PFR. Currently it contains the top 60 players per season at each of the four offensive fantasy football positions. I Plan to continue to update it annually.</p>
      <h2>Future</h2>
      <p>There are a number of tweaks, updates, and improvements I plan to make.</p>
      <ul class="long-li-list">
        <li>Add a slider that will set the limit on the position rank of the players returned. For instance, a user could view only the top 20 running backs rather than getting all 60.</li>
        <li>Retain the JSON dataset with <code>localStorage</code>, and add some kind of version detection to load and save the dataset from the server when it's updated.</li>
        <li>Improve input validation and provide contextual help when users fail to complete the fields required to produce a scatterplot.</li>
      </ul>
