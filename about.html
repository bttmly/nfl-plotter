      <p>This tool is still in development and should not be considered a finished product. </p>
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>Plotter is a tool that creates scatterplots of NFL player data. It was developed specifically with fantasy football in mind, to help visualize trends that occur over time at a positional level. For instance, graphing fantasy points against position rank for 2012 and 2008 shows that in general the <em>n</em>-th highest scoring running back contributed substantially more points over a season in 2008 than in 2012. These kinds of insights can–and should–inform draft strategy and roster construction.</p>
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>I based the visual style on a set of <a href="http://cssdeck.com/labs/flat-forms">flat form elements</a> I had previously developed. Colors are cribbed from <a href="http://flatuicolors.com">Flat UI Colors</a>. The typeface used here is CamingoDos Web, served by <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts">Typekit</a>.</p>
      <h2>Code</h2>
      <p>Plotter runs entirely on the client. The dataset is a single large JSON file, delivered to the client asynchronously.</p>
      <p>The chart drawing function uses <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>, a great data visualization library. Other libraries include: <a href="http://brehaut.net/code/color">Color.js</a> for color manipulation; <a href="http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/">Chosen.js</a> with a <a href="https://github.com/nickb1080/chosen/blob/master/public/chosen.css">custom stylesheet</a> using relative units and a tiny data-URI font for icons; and of course <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.</p>
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>This dataset is collected from the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2012/fantasy.htm">fantasy stats</a> provided by PFR. Currently it contains the top 60 players per season at each of the four offensive fantasy football positions. I Plan to continue to update it annually.</p>
      <h2>Future</h2>
      <p>I plan to continue tweaking and adding features for the forseeable future. The next addition will be a filtering slider to limit the number of player-seasons returned. </p>
